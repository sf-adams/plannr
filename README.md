## Challenge Details

Build a mini “Collaborative Task Board” (a simplified Trello-like app) that lets authenticated users create boards, add lists and cards, and see updates in real time when another user makes a change.

### Getting Started

Run the following command:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Tech Stack

- [ ] Front-end: React (with Hooks) + TypeScript
- [ ] Back-end: Node.js + NestJS + TypeScript
- [ ] Database: MongoDB
- [ ] Real-time: WebSockets (e.g. Socket.IO)
- [ ] Auth: JWT-based signup/login
- [ ] Testing: Jest (unit + integration)

_Feel free to substitute equivalent frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Fastify, Prisma) as long as you can justify your choices._
